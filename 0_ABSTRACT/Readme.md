# WIPER CONTROL SYSTEM

## Abstract

The objective of the project is to show the exact working of the Car Wiper System using the STM32F4xx-discovery board Here the STM32F4xx-discovery board contains Four LED'S which instead act as the wiper . The Car wiper system undergoes many technical works for the wiper to perform with a range of three speed thats controlled by a DC motor .The project has been developed to carry out the idea of the wiper control system of the car into the STM32F4xx , In car the wipers act as a cleaning tool but here LED are her to indicate the wipers . As the wiper of the car starts through ignition and it poses 3 rangge of speed and that spped is here compared with the LED light ON and OFF .GPIO pins of STM32F407VG microcontroller will be configured as digital input pins to enable a push button to operate with STM32F4. If you press the user button and hold it for two seconds, the Red LED turns on, indicating the ignition key is positioned at the ACC. In addition, the LEDs are blinking, which indicates the wipers are ON.
